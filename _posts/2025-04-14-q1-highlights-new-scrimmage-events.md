Spring has arrived in 2025, and SCVC kicked off the year with some exciting new formats. Thank you for your participation and support! As the Seattle sun returns, let’s take a quick look back at what we’ve accomplished in Q1 👇

This year, we launched two regular **scrimmage events** to provide more high-quality playing and training opportunities beyond weekly practices:

✅ **Friday Night Scrimmage @ Mercer Island** – Held every Friday night at the Mercer Island gym with three courts available. A perfect environment for teams to build chemistry and gain match experience in a relaxed yet competitive setting!  
✅ **Sunday Afternoon Scrimmage/Practice @ Crossroads** – Held every Sunday afternoon with one court focused on structured training and high-intensity games. Great for players and teams looking to level up their strategies and skills! 🔥  

Join us and bring your teammates along to train, compete, and connect!  
欢迎大家踊跃参加，也欢迎带上你的队友一起来切磋交流！
