## Volleyball Practice

Our volleyball practice sessions happen every Sunday morning at the Tyee community gym. This practice session is good for new volleyball players to learn and improve volleyball skills.

To join the practice session, please login to our [game signup portal](https://joingame.azurewebsites.net/) and signup for one of the practice games. Signup starts every Wednesday evening. Please note that the capacity may run out fast after the signup starts.

## Volleyball Open Gym

Our volleyball open gym happen every Saturday evening at the Ridge activity center. Currently we have 2 game levels: B/B+ level and B+/BB level. Games on each level require a corresponding permit to signup to ensure the game quality. All games have a 12 players capacity to guarantee everyone's playing time.

If you would like to join our open gym, please fill the questionare at <https://www.jotform.com/250478918366167>. We'll then contact you to schedule a tryout for one of our games. After the tryout, we'll add corresponding permit to your account so that you can signup for our future games. Our expectation of each skill level can be viewed at our [skill levels](/skill-levels) page.
